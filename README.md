## Hello! I'm wujinhjun

## I want to be a web developer or designer

I am currently enrolled in the Industrial Design major at the Design School of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My plan is to become a front-end developer.  

- From June 2023 to September 2023, I worked as a front-end intern at [YueWen Group](https://www.yuewen.com/), participating in projects.  
- In the past, I have studied courses such as Modern Front-end Development, Data Structures, Software Engineering, Computer Networks, and others.
